### Contribute to the FAQ

If you don't see your question here or if you'd like to contribute a FAQ, please create and submit it as a [new issue](https://github.com/INN-SFU/BRS_Training/issues/new/choose). We'll respond to your question and post it here as soon as we can. Thank you!

### I can't access the project directory

Make sure that the path you are trying to access begins with `/project/ctb-rmcintos`. You won't find the project directory from your home directory (`~`).

### I can't get in Cedar

Cedar is being decommissioned and replaced with [Fir](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Fir). Please use `fir.alliancecan.ca` instead of `cedar.computecanada.ca`.
